# Research Narrative Business Prompting
In this experiment, you will create a case study with the help of a Large Language Model (LLM). This research will help develop and prove the use value of an assisted narrative business prompting framework. Find the experiment on https://narrativebusinessprompting-n1twtmtky4g.streamlit.app/

We will link our upcoming presentations / papers / DOIs / here.

## If you want to come up with your own experiment
We encourage researchers to create own LLM-based experiments.
Our Tech-Stack:
1. LLM: OpenAI
2. Frontend- & Backendservices: Snowflake Inc. (Streamlit)
3. Hosting: Streamlit-Cloud (actually, here is more involved, but this is a starter)

### How to keep the app alive
Streamlit-apps have the tendency to fall into a deep-sleep mode after some days. To prevent that:
- Open app daily
- Commit 
- Write a script to automate that
